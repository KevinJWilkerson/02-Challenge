# Horiseon Code Refactor Project

For this project, we were given existing code for a hypothetical marketing agency and instructed to refactor it with a few specific instructions, namely:
- Improve the page's accessibility by incorporating semantic HTML elements and alt attributes for images 
- Organize the page's elements with a logical structure and flow
- Clean up the CSS, consolidating selectors and properties throughout and organizing them to mirror the semantic structure of the refactored HTML

The resulting webpage had the same appearance, but is more accessible, with better search engine optimization and more navigable HTML and CSS code.
